# RISC-V CPU Implementation in Verilog

This is a simple (single cycle datapath) 32-bit RISC-V compatable CPU. I plan to add more complexity this project progresses.

# Goals/Progress updates:
- Currently working on these components: Mux, ALU
- Completed these components: [None]
- Components to be completed: Instruction memory, Data memory, Registers, Program counter, Control, Sign extend
